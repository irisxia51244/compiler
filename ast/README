run 'make depend' once
then 'make' to build

builds two sample programs

  test_prog:  draws AST to stdout
        to run:
        ./test_prog

  test_nltk:  creates a python output file that can be used by the nltk
              tree drawing library

        to run:
        ./test_nltk outputfile

        then:
        python -i outputfile
        >>>  ast.draw()

        note: it will take a long time for python to draw very large ASTs
