* first, run: make depend 
  ignore the warnings about not being able to find stddef.h etc.

* to compile: make 

* to run the lexer:
        ./lexer source_code_file
  example:
        ./lexer ../test_suite/test_arrays.c-- 

* if you add more .h files, put them in the includes subdirectory
* if you add more .c files, add them to the SRCS def in the Makefile 

* Changes from PART 1-3 : 
  the new token types are: keyword, identifier, num, operators and punctuation
  Considering the condition of NUM in a different way. In this stage, all the 
  letters and digits between two paired double quotes are recognized as a single NUM.
  Ignore the case when they are between two single quotes, since C does not allow to 
  check if a variable is ‘’’.
